🌱 Carbon Footprint Dashboard (Python Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes an organization’s carbon footprint (GHG emissions) using Python.
The goal is to understand emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3, identify hotspots, and track year-over-year trends.

📂 Dataset

File: carbon_footprint_sample.csv

Example fields:

Year → Reporting year

Scope → Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 (emissions classification)

Location → Business unit / region

Emissions_tCO2 → Emissions in metric tons of CO₂ equivalent

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (for analysis & visualization)

📊 Analysis Performed

Aggregated emissions by Scope and Year

Calculated total emissions trend over time

Compared emissions across locations

Visualized emission shares by scope (latest year)

📈 Visualizations

Bar Chart → Emissions by Scope & Year

Line Chart → Total emissions trend

Pie Chart → Scope-wise share of emissions (latest year)


🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carbon-footprint-dashboard.git
cd carbon-footprint-dashboard


Install required libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib


Place your dataset (carbon_footprint_sample.csv) in the project folder.

Run the script:

python carbon_dashboard.py

📌 Key Insights
